The goal of this application is to provide students with information valuable to their academic career and social life at universities, solving the problem of lack of interconnectedness in universities and the lack of accessible testimonials on school experiences, research professors, and academic opportunities.
Split into five parts, there is the main feed, category page, posting page, database, and profile. This was created with a front-end of SwiftUI and a backend of Firebase. Further tweaks are needed to deploy this app. A desktop version is to be made in the future.
