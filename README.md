Social platform to provide students with information valuable to their academic career and social life at universities. 
Solves the following problem: lack of interconnectedness in universities and lack of accessible testimonials on school experiences, research professors, and academic opportunities.

Split into five parts: the main feed, category page, posting page, database, and profile. 
Further tweaks are needed to deploy this app. A desktop version is to be made in the future.
